# Firebase-Project
This program is supposed to allow the user to store and retrieve data into and from the cloud using google's firebase program. The code is not debugged because I was unable to get the firebase tools installed on my developing enviroment

Development instructions
To set up the proper enviroment to run the program, complete the following:
1. Download and install Visual Studio Code
2. Download and install Python
3. Install Firebase admin tools
3. Download the files included within the Github repository
4. run the fireBase program within Visual Studio code

After following these steps the program should connect to a remote firebase server where information can be stored and retreived
The code is not yet debugged for errors, so be aware inital run will have difficulties.
